    "- WEATHER: Describing wheather conditions with attribute options like Clear, Overcast, Raining, Fog, Crosswind, Snow, and other\n",
    "- ROADCOND: Describing road conditions with attribute options like Dry, Wet, Ice, Oil, Standing Water, and other\n",
    "- LIGHTCOND: Describing light conditions with attribute options like Daylight, Dawn, and Dark with different status of artificial/street light\n",
    "- SPEEDING: Might have an influence, but the dataset used seems not to provide enough data for it\n",
    "- ADDRTYPE: Describing the address type where a collision took place with the options Alley, Block, and Intersection\n",
    "- COLLISIONTYPE: Describing the type of the collision with options like parked car, right turn, pedestrian, and others\n",
    "- VEHICLECOUNT: Describing the number of vehicles involved in the accident\n",
    "- SDOTCOLLISION\n",
    "- DATE/TIME\n"
