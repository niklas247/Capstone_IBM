    "Vehicle accidents can have tremendous impacts on a persons life - both from a health perspective but also on a financial one.\n",
    "On those, multiple factors like traffic, rain, snow, wind,\n",
    "or road conditions can determine the likeliness and severity of an accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Can it be possible to determine and quantify the risk even before starting the engine by knowing certain conditions that can be expected during the ride?*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the goal of this research is to help people to evaluate overall risk of a vehicle travel out of the combination of likeliness\n",
    "of an accident and potential impact / severity, so that drivers can make better decisions for themselves and other people."

    "\n",
    "For this Capstone Project, a Collision data set will be used that includes information about almost 200,000 accidents recorded in Seattle, WA, since year 2004.\n",
    "From those accidents, 5085 did not involve vehicles but just pedestrians and cyclists. Those will be excluded from the analysis.\n",
    "Overall, the data set contains various variables with possible influence on the target variable, the **SEVERITY** of an accident.\n",
    "Those predictor variables include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *WEATHER:* Describing wheather conditions with attribute options like Clear, Overcast, Raining, Fog, Crosswind, Snow, and other\n",
    "- *ROADCOND:* Describing road conditions with attribute options like Dry, Wet, Ice, Oil, Standing Water, and other\n",
    "- *LIGHTCOND:* Describing light conditions with attribute options like Daylight, Dawn, and Dark with different status of artificial/street light\n",
    "- *ADDRTYPE:* Describing the address type where a collision took place with the options Alley, Block, and Intersection\n",
    "- *COLLISIONTYPE:* Describing the type of the collision with options like parked car, right turn, pedestrian, and others\n",
    "- *VEHICLECOUNT:* Describing the number of vehicles involved in the accident\n",
    "- *DATE/TIME:* Describing date and time of when the accident happened\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, this data will be examined via exploratory analysis to identify the most influential predictor variables.\n"
